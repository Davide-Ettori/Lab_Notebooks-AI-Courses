    "## Set Covering greedy algorithm\n",
    "Many real-world optimization problems can be expressed as variants or extensions of the set cover problem. We define a finite set of objects $U = \\{x_1, . . . , x_m\\}$ as the universe, and S = $\\{s_1, . . . , s_n\\}$ a collection of subsets of $U$, such that every element of $U$ belongs to at least one set of $S$.\n",

    "**input**: collection $S$ of sets over universe $U$, costs $c: S → \\mathbb{R}_+$\n",

    "1. Let $C \\gets \\emptyset$;\n",
    "2. Repeat until $C$ is a set cover;\n",
    "3. Find a set $s \\in S$ maximizing the number of elements in $s$ not yet covered by any set in $C$, divided by the cost $c_s$;\n",

    "**Theorem** The greedy set-cover algorithm returns a set cover of cost at most $H(d)$ opt, where opt is the minimum cost of any set cover, $d=\\max_{s∈S}\\{|s|\\}$ is the maximum set size, and $H(d)$≈$0.58+\\ln(d)$ is the $d$-th Harmonic number.\n",
